# @adverserial/claude-code-plugin

Verify the attestation of the Adverserial confidential inference endpoint
from inside [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) — as a
session hook, a slash command, an agent skill, and a status-line badge.

It wraps the TypeScript SDK (`@adverserial/sdk`, `../../typescript`) through
the shared core in `../shared`: fresh nonce-bound TDX evidence + ES256
verification receipt, checked against pinned receipt keys. Without pinned
keys it **refuses to claim "verified"**; the explicit escape hatch
(`--trust-evidence-key` / `ADVERSERIAL_TRUST_EVIDENCE_KEY=1`) TOFU-bootstraps
the ephemeral key from the evidence and the verdict reads **UNPINNED (TOFU
dev mode)**. Production deployments pin the key set published at
https://verify.adverserial.ai.

```

`bin/adverserial-verify` loads the self-contained verifier bundle tracked in
this plugin directory. It works from a local checkout and from Claude Code's
versioned GitHub marketplace cache.

## Install

Register the public GitHub marketplace and install the plugin:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add AdverserialAI/confidential-sdk --ref main
claude plugin install adverserial-verify-claude@adverserial
```

(or, inside a session: `/plugin marketplace add AdverserialAI/confidential-sdk`,
then `/plugin install adverserial-verify-claude@adverserial`.) Restart Claude
Code, or run `/reload-plugins` in an existing session.

## Send Claude Code through the confidential gateway

The plugin provides verification UX. Configure the actual inference transport
as well, otherwise Claude Code continues to use its normal provider. Start
`adverserial-confidential-gateway`, then source the maintained profile from
the repository root:

```sh
source /absolute/path/to/confidential-sdk/profiles/claude-code.confidential.sh
claude
```

This selects the gateway's native Anthropic Messages endpoint. It preserves
function definitions, `tool_use`/`tool_result` history, streamed tool JSON,
and text deltas. The gateway independently validates the fresh runtime proof
before dispatch and the signed inference receipt before ending the stream.

The profile also pins Claude Code's background and small/fast agent roles to
`lordx64/cyberglm`. As a compatibility safeguard, the loopback gateway maps
only Claude-family child-model aliases to that canonical ID before it verifies
the runtime or requests an entitlement; no alias reaches billing or the CVM.

The same GitHub install covers the Claude Code CLI and desktop app — both
read <code>~/.claude</code>. The plugin cache includes the verifier bundle, so
no local TypeScript build or sibling checkout is required for attestation.

### What you get

| Component | Name | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slash command | `/adverserial-verify-claude:attestation` | Runs a fresh check, prints the verdict table |
| Skill | `/adverserial-verify-claude:adverserial-verify` | Also auto-loads when you ask Claude to verify the endpoint |
| SessionStart hook | (matcher `startup\|resume`) | Runs the CLI once per session; the verdict table is added to Claude's context |
| Executables | `bin/` is on the Bash tool's `PATH` | `adverserial-verify` runnable as a bare command while the plugin is enabled |

## Usage

```sh
# fresh check, prints the verdict table, exit 0 = verified / 1 = not
node bin/adverserial-verify

# network-free status of the last result
node bin/adverserial-verify --status

# raw JSON verdict
node bin/adverserial-verify --json
```

Inside a session, run `/adverserial-verify-claude:attestation` or ask the
agent to "verify the Adverserial endpoint" — the skill teaches it to run the
CLI, interpret the verdict (including `dev_mode` and UNPINNED states), and
never paraphrase a failed/unpinned verdict as verified.

### Status line

Wire the cached verdict into the Claude Code status line via
`~/.claude/settings.json`. The script reads the verdict cache and the status
JSON Claude Code pipes to stdin; it does no network I/O:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node /absolute/path/to/confidential-sdk/plugins/claude-code/bin/adverserial-statusline.mjs"
  }
}
```

Point it at your checkout, not the plugin cache — the cache path changes on
every plugin update, and `settings.json` does not expand
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ADVERSERIAL_API_URL` | `https://api.adverserial.ai/v1` | Endpoint base URL |
| `ADVERSERIAL_MODEL` | `lordx64/cyberglm` | Expected receipt `model_id` |
| `ADVERSERIAL_ISSUER` | `https://verify.adverserial.ai` | Expected receipt `iss` |
| `ADVERSERIAL_AUDIENCE` | `https://chat.adverserial.ai` | Expected receipt `aud` |
| `ADVERSERIAL_EXPECTED_ENDPOINT` | unset | Also pin the receipt `endpoint` claim |
| `ADVERSERIAL_RECEIPT_KEYS_JSON` | unset | Pinned keys: JSON map kid → public JWK |
| `ADVERSERIAL_RECEIPT_KEYS_FILE` | unset | Path to a JSON file with that map |
| `ADVERSERIAL_TRUST_EVIDENCE_KEY` | unset | `=1` enables the TOFU dev escape hatch |
| `ADVERSERIAL_HARDWARE_VERIFIER_COMMAND` | unset | Required executable that independently validates TDX/GPU evidence; no value means verification fails closed |
| `ADVERSERIAL_CACHE_FILE` | `~/.cache/adverserial/verify.json` | `--status` cache location |

Notes:

- The keys file is a JSON object mapping key id → public EC P-256 JWK, e.g.
  `{"<kid>": {"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","x":"…","y":"…"}}`. Set only one of
  `ADVERSERIAL_RECEIPT_KEYS_JSON` / `ADVERSERIAL_RECEIPT_KEYS_FILE`.
- The shipped `typescript/bin/adverserial-hardware-verify.mjs` is the
  reference hardware verifier; point `ADVERSERIAL_HARDWARE_VERIFIER_COMMAND`
  at it (or a shim wrapping it).
- Export the environment in the shell you launch `claude` from so the
  SessionStart hook inherits it.
- Against a DEV_MODE attest-proxy (self-signed TLS) on loopback, the TOFU
  escape additionally disables CA validation for the process, with a loud
  stderr warning. For a non-loopback self-signed endpoint, set
  `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` yourself (dev only).
- Node fetch cannot pin the TLS SPKI (see the SDK README); the CLI surfaces
  `tls_spki_sha256` in the verdict. For hard channel pinning use the Python
  SDK's `VerifiedSession`.
