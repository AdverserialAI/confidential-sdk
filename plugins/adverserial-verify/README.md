# Adverserial Verify — Codex plugin

Verify the attestation of the Adverserial confidential inference endpoint
before trusting it with code, secrets, or prompts from
[Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) (Codex CLI and the Codex
desktop app — both share `~/.codex`).

A proxy receipt is not hardware proof. The bundled skill requires all three
checks before the endpoint may be called confidential: pinned receipt keys
and policy from `https://verify.adverserial.ai`, fresh nonce-bound endpoint
evidence, and an independent TDX/GPU verifier named by
`ADVERSERIAL_HARDWARE_VERIFIER_COMMAND`. Missing any one of these is a
failure, never a "verified" result.

## Layout

```
adverserial-verify/
├── .codex-plugin/plugin.json         # Codex plugin manifest (skill)
├── skills/adverserial-verify/SKILL.md
└── prompts/attestation.md            # custom prompt → /prompts:attestation
```

## Install the slash prompt

Custom prompts live in the Codex home directory and become slash commands
named after the file. Install once for both Codex CLI and the Codex desktop
app:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
cp prompts/attestation.md ~/.codex/prompts/
```

Restart Codex (new CLI session, or reopen the app chat) so it loads the
file, then invoke it as `/prompts:attestation`. It runs the verifier CLI and
reports the verdict table verbatim — a failed or UNPINNED (TOFU) verdict is
never paraphrased as verified.

Notes:

- OpenAI now [deprecates custom prompts in favor of
  skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/custom-prompts); the bundled
  `adverserial-verify` skill below covers the same behavior and can also be
  invoked implicitly. The prompt remains for users who want an explicit
  slash command.
- Some desktop builds have a known issue surfacing `~/.codex/prompts` files
  in the slash menu; the CLI is unaffected, and the skill works regardless.

## The skill

`skills/adverserial-verify/SKILL.md` teaches Codex the verification policy:
run the locally installed `adverserial-verify` CLI before using a
confidential endpoint, never treat TOFU mode, synthetic `dev=true` evidence,
a proxy receipt by itself, or a missing hardware verifier as a verified TEE,
and keep API keys local (the confidential gateway exchanges them for a
five-minute single-request entitlement at `billing.adverserial.ai` and
forwards only the entitlement).

The verifier CLI itself is built from this repository's plugins workspace
(`npm install && npm run build` in `plugins/`, then
`plugins/kimi-code/bin/adverserial-verify`; put it on PATH as
`adverserial-verify` for the smoothest experience).

## Send Codex through the confidential gateway

Copy [`../../profiles/codex.confidential.toml`](../../profiles/codex.confidential.toml)
to `~/.codex/confidential.config.toml` and start Codex with the profile after
the local gateway is running:

```sh
codex --profile confidential
```

The profile uses the native Responses endpoint and disables OpenAI-account
fallback for this model. The gateway preserves Responses function calls and
function-call outputs, streams function-argument events, obtains a one-use
billing entitlement, and requires the final runtime receipt before a turn can
complete.

## Environment

```sh
export ADVERSERIAL_API_URL='https://api.adverserial.ai/v1'             # default
export ADVERSERIAL_MODEL='lordx64/cyberglm'                            # default
export ADVERSERIAL_RECEIPT_KEYS_FILE="$HOME/.config/adverserial/receipt-keys.json"
export ADVERSERIAL_HARDWARE_VERIFIER_COMMAND='/absolute/path/to/adverserial-hardware-verify'
```

The keys file is a JSON object mapping key id → public EC P-256 JWK. The key
set and hardware verifier come from the signed policy published at
`https://verify.adverserial.ai`; the shipped
`typescript/bin/adverserial-hardware-verify.mjs` in this repository is the
reference verifier. Do not substitute an untrusted URL or a shell command.
